# Health insurance cross sell prediction-Machine Learning Classification Project


Welcome to my Machine Learning Regression project! This personal project focuses on predicting whether policyholders from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by our client, an Insurance company. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify potential customers interested in Vehicle Insurance based on various demographics, vehicle, and policy-related factors.

### Problem Statement
Our client, an Insurance company, wants to optimize its communication strategy to reach out to customers interested in Vehicle Insurance. The task is to predict customer interest in Vehicle Insurance using historical data. This information includes demographics (gender, age, region code type), vehicle details (vehicle age, damage), and policy-related data (premium, sourcing channel).

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains crucial information about policyholders from the past year. It includes various attributes related to demographics, vehicles, and policies. Data preprocessing techniques, such as handling missing data and encoding categorical variables, were applied to prepare the dataset for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building the predictive model, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. This involved checking the distribution of the response variable, comparing counts of various columns, exploring correlations, and understanding the relationships between different features and customer interest in Vehicle Insurance.

### Model Building
To predict customer interest, we implemented several machine learning regression models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes

### Model Performance
After evaluating the models, we identified the K Nearest Neighbors with the best performance on the test dataset.
